### My Journey into Development

</div>

It all started with a simple goal: finding a fun Minecraft server to play on. Like many kids, I was just exploring the world of gaming — but curiosity quickly turned into creation. I began experimenting, eventually building my own Minecraft servers, filled with unique ideas and custom features. What began as a hobby turned into a passion, and I became a professional Minecraft developer.

As I grew older, I realized it wasn't just about games — it was about code. Programming captured my interest far beyond game mechanics. After countless tutorials, trial and error, and more copy-pasting than I'd like to admit, something clicked: I finally understood what I was actually writing. Code started making sense, and the real journey began.

My life took another turn when faith became a central part of it. Jesus entered my life, and I began to see how I was spending my time. Video games were fun, but they were also a distraction from something greater. I chose to step away from professional Minecraft development and pursue something deeper — a true career in software development.

Today, I'm a developer who not only writes code but understands it. And more importantly, I aim to build things that matter.
